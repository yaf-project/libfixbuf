 * @mainpage libfixbuf - IPFIX Protocol Library
 *
 * \subpage How-To
 *
 * @section Introduction
 *
 * libfixbuf is a compliant implementation of the IPFIX Protocol,
 * as defined in the "Specification of the IPFIX Protocol for the Exchange of
 * Flow Information" ([RFC 7011][]). It supports the information model
 * defined in "Information Model for IP Flow Information Export"
 * ([RFC 7012][]), extended as proposed by "Bidirectional Flow Export using
 * IPFIX" ([RFC 5103][]) to support information elements for representing
 * biflows.  libfixbuf supports structured data elements as described
 * in "Export of Structured Data in IPFIX" ([RFC 6313][]), which adds the
 * ability to export basicLists, subTemplateLists, and subTemplateMultiLists.
 * libfixbuf can export type information for IPFIX
 * elements as described in "Exporting Type Information for IPFIX Information
 * Elements" ([RFC 5610][]), and it supports reading this information.
 *
 * libfixbuf supports UDP, TCP, SCTP, TLS over TCP, and Spread as transport
 * protocols. Support for DTLS over UDP and DTLS over SCTP is forthcoming.
 * It also supports operation as an IPFIX File Writer or IPFIX File Reader as
 * defined in "Specification of the IPFIX File Format" ([RFC 5655][]).
 *
 * libfixbuf's public API is defined in public.h; see the \ref How-To section
 * or public.h for general documentation on getting started with libfixbuf, as
 * well as detailed documentation on the public API calls and data types.
 *
 * Two command line tools to view the contents of an IPFIX file are available
 * from the separate [fixbuf-tools][] package: [ipfix2json][] produces JSON
 * and [ipfixDump][] produces human-readable text.  (ipfixDump was distributed
 * as part of libfixbuf in the libfixbuf-2.3.x and libfixbuf-2.4.x releases
 * and previously as part of YAF.)
 *
 * A Python API to libfixbuf is available in the [pyfixbuf][] package,
 * distributed separately.

 *
 * @section Downloading
 *
 * libfixbuf is distributed from
 * https://tools.netsa.cert.org/fixbuf2/download.html
 *
 * @section Building
 *
 * libfixbuf uses a reasonably standard autotools-based build system.
 * The customary build procedure (`./configure && make && make install`)
 * should work in most environments.
 *
 * libfixbuf requires [GLib-2.0][] version 2.18 or later. GLib is available on
 * most modern Linux distributions and BSD ports collections or in
 * [source form][].
 *
 * libfixbuf automatically uses the getaddrinfo(3) facility and the
 * accompanying dual IPv4/IPv6 stack support if present. getaddrinfo(3)
 * must be present to export or collect flows over IPv6.
 *
 * libfixbuf does not build with SCTP support by default. The --with-sctp
 * option must be given to the libfixbuf ./configure script to include SCTP
 * support. Also note that SCTP requires kernel support, and applications
 * built against libfixbuf with libsctp may fail at runtime if that kernel
 * support is not present.
 *
 * libfixbuf does not build with TLS support by default. The --with-openssl
 * option must be given to the libfixbuf ./configure script to include TLS
 * support.
 *
 * Spread support requires [Spread][] 4.1 or
 * later. libfixbuf does not build with Spread support by default.
 * The --with-spread option must be given to libfixbuf ./configure script to
 * include Spread support.
 *
 * [GLib-2.0]:     https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/
 * [Spread]:       http://www.spread.org/
 * [source form]:  https://download.gnome.org/sources/glib/
 *
 * @section Known Issues
 *
 * The following are known issues with libfixbuf as of version 1.0.0:
 *
 *   - There is no support for DTLS over UDP or DTLS over SCTP transport.
 *   - There is no support for application-selectable SCTP stream assignment
 *     or SCTP partial reliability. Templates are sent reliably on stream 0,
 *     and data sets are sent reliably on stream 1.
 *   - There is no automatic support for periodic template retransmission
 *     or periodic template expiration as required when transporting IPFIX
 *     over UDP. Applications using libfixbuf to transport IPFIX messages
 *     over UDP must maintain these timeouts and manually manage the session.
 *     However, inactive UDP collector sessions are timed out after 30 minutes,
 *     at which time the session is freed and all templates associated with the
 *     session are removed.

 *
 * @section types Data Types
 *
 * public.h defines the data types and routines required to support IPFIX
 * Exporting Process and IPFIX Collecting Process creation. Each data type is
 * manipulated primarily by routines named "fb" followed by the type name
 * (e.g., "Session", "Collector") followed by a description of the routine's
 * action. The routines operating on the fBuf_t IPFIX Message buffer type are
 * named beginning with "fBuf".
 *
 * The @ref fBuf_t opaque type implements a transcoding IPFIX Message buffer
 * for both export and collection, and is the "core" interface to the fixbuf
 * library.
 *
 * The @ref fbInfoModel_t opaque type implements an IPFIX Information Model,
 * including both [IANA managed][] Information Elements and vendor-specific
 * Information Elements. The @ref fbTemplate_t opaque type implements an IPFIX
 * Template or an IPFIX Options Template. Both are defined in terms of
 * Information Elements, represented by the @ref fbInfoElement_t public type.
 * An fBuf_t message buffer maintains internal Templates, which represent
 * records within the fixbuf application client, and external Templates,
 * which represent records as they appear on the wire, for use during
 * transcoding. For a Spread Exporter, Templates are managed per group.  For
 * a Spread Collector, Templates are managed per Session.
 *
 * The state of an IPFIX Transport Session, including IPFIX Message Sequence
 * Number tracking and the internal and external Templates in use within the
 * Session, are maintained by the @ref fbSession_t opaque type.
 *
 * An Exporting Process' connection to its corresponding Collecting Process is
 * encapsulated by the @ref fbExporter_t opaque type. Exporters may be created
 * to connect via the network using one of the supported IPFIX transport
 * protocols, or to write to IPFIX Files specified by name or by open ANSI C
 * file pointer.
 *
 * A Collecting Process' connection to a corresponding Exporting Process is
 * encapsulated by the @ref fbCollector_t opaque type. The passive connection
 * used to listen for connections from Exporting Processes is managed by the
 * @ref fbListener_t opaque type; Collectors can be made to read from IPFIX
 * Files specified directly by name or by open ANSI C file pointer, as well.
 *
 * Network addresses are specified for Exporters, Collectors, and Listeners
 * using the @ref fbConnSpec_t and @ref fbTransport_t public types.
 *
 * This file also defines the GError error codes used by all the fixbuf types
 * and routines within the FB_ERROR_DOMAIN domain.
 *

 * [RFC 7011]:     https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7011
 *
 * @page export Exporter Usage
 *
 * How-To Export IPFIX
 *
 * Each fixbuf application must have a single @ref fbInfoModel_t instance that
 * represents the Information Elements that the application understands.
 * The fbInfoModelAlloc() call allocates a new Information Model with the
 * IANA-managed information elements (current as of the fixbuf release date)
 * preloaded. Additional vendor-specific information elements may be added
 * with fbInfoModelAddElement(), fbInfoModelAddElementArray(),
 * fbInfoModelReadXMLFile(), and fbInfoModelReadXMLData().
 *
 * To create an Exporter, first create an @ref fbSession_t attached to the
 * application's @ref fbInfoModel_t to hold the Exporter's Transport Session
 * state using fbSessionAlloc(). If exporting via the Spread protocol, create
 * an @ref fbSpreadParams_t and set its `session` member to your newly defined
 * fbSession_t, group names (a null terminated array), and Spread daemon name.
 *
 * Then create an @ref fbExporter_t to encapsulate the connection to the
 * Collecting Process or the file on disk, using the fbExporterAllocFP(),
 * fbExporterAllocFile(), fbExporterAllocNet(), fbExporterAllocBuffer(),
 * or fbExporterAllocSpread() calls.
 *
 * With an fbSession_t and an fbExporter_t available, create a buffer (@ref
 * fBuf_t) for writing via fBufAllocForExport().
 *
 * Create and populate templates for addition to this session using
 * fbTemplateAlloc() and fbTemplateAppendSpecArray(), fbTemplateAppendSpec(),
 * or fbTemplateAppend()).  The layout of the template usually matches the C
 * `struct` that holds the record.  Any gaps (due to alignment) in the C
 * `struct` must be noted in both the data structure and the template.
 *
 * Example code:
 * @code
 *    static fbInfoElementSpec_t exportTemplate[] = {
 *        {"flowStartMilliseconds",               8, 0 },
 *        {"flowEndMilliseconds",                 8, 0 },
 *        {"octetTotalCount",                     8, 0 },
 *        {"packetTotalCount",                    8, 0 },
 *        {"sourceIPv4Address",                   4, 0 },
 *        {"destinationIPv4Address",              4, 0 },
 *        {"sourceTransportPort",                 2, 0 },
 *        {"destinationTransportPort",            2, 0 },
 *        {"protocolIdentifier",                  1, 0 },
 *        {"paddingOctets",                       3, 0 },
 *        {"payload",                             0, 0 },
 *        FB_IESPEC_NULL
 *    };
 *    typedef struct exportRecord_st {
 *        uint64_t      flowStartMilliseconds;
 *        uint64_t      flowEndMilliseconds;
 *        uint64_t      octetTotalCount;
 *        uint64_t      packetTotalCount;
 *        uint32_t      sourceIPv4Address;
 *        uint32_t      destinationIPv4Address;
 *        uint16_t      sourceTransportPort;
 *        uint16_t      destinationTransportPort;
 *        uint8_t       protocolIdentifier;
 *        uint8_t       padding[3];
 *        fbVarfield_t  payload;
 *    } exportRecord_t;
 *    fbTemplate_t *tmpl = fbTemplateAlloc(infoModel);
 *    fbTemplateAppendSpecArray(tmpl, exportTemplate, UINT32_MAX, &err);
 *  @endcode
 *
 * The `flags` member of @ref fbInfoElementSpec_st allows creation of multiple
 * templates from a single spec array.  The template-building functions
 * fbTemplateAppendSpec(), fbTemplateAppendSpecArray(), and
 * fbTemplateContainsAllFlaggedElementsByName() take a parameter also named
 * `flags`.  If an @ref fbInfoElementSpec_t's `flags` is 0, the spec is always
 * used.  When the spec's `flags` is non-zero, the spec is used only if spec's
 * `flags` intersected with (bit-wise AND) the function's `flags` parameter
 * equals the spec's `flags`.  That is, the high bits of the `flags` parameter
 * must include all the high bits of the spec's `flags`.  In general, the
 * `flags` member of an @ref fbInfoElementSpec_t should have few high bits.
 * The functions' `flags` parameter generally contains multiple high bits to
 * include multiple specs.  Consider this spec array:
 *
 *  @code
 *    fbInfoElementSpec_t spec_array[] = {
 *        {"protocolIdentifier",       1,  0},
 *        {"paddingOctets",            3,  8},
 *        {"sourceTransportPort",      2,  1},
 *        {"destinationTransportPort", 2,  1},
 *        {"paddingOctets",            5, 16},
 *        {"icmpTypeIPv4",             1,  2},
 *        {"icmpCodeIPv4",             1,  2},
 *        {"icmpTypeIPv6",             1,  4},
 *        {"icmpCodeIPv6",             1,  4},
 *        FB_IESPEC_NULL
 *    };
 *  @endcode
 *
 * The protocol is included in every template since the `flags` member value
 * is 0.  The ports are included when the `flags` parameter is 1.  When
 * building a template that maps to the following C `struct` (where padding is
 * necessary for member alignment), the `flags` parameter should be 9.
 *
 *  @code
 *    struct proto_ports = {
 *        uint8_t   protocol;
 *        uint8_t   padding[3];
 *        uint16_t  source_port;
 *        uint16_t  dest_port;
 *    };
 *  @endcode
 *
 * For ICMP records, the `flags` parameter should be 2 or 4 depending on
 * whether the record is IPv4 or IPv6, respectively.  To map the template to
 * the following `struct`, the `flags` parameter should be 18 for IPv4 and 20
 * for IPv6.
 *
 *  @code
 *    struct proto_ports = {
 *        uint8_t   protocol;
 *        uint8_t   padding[5];
 *        uint8_t   icmp_type;
 *        uint8_t   icmp_code;
 *    };
 *  @endcode
 *
 * Add the templates to the session via fbSessionAddTemplate() or
 * fbSessionAddTemplateWithMetadata().
 *
 * If exporting via Spread, before calling fbSessionAddTemplate(), set the
 * group that should receive this template with the fBufSetSpreadExportGroup()
 * call.  If more than 1 group should receive the template, use the
 * fbSessionAddTemplatesMulticast() which will call fBufSetSpreadExportGroup()
 * on the given group(s) multicast the template to the given group(s).
 * For Spread, do not use fbSessionAddTemplate() to send to multiple groups.
 *
 * Typically each template is added to the session twice, once as an internal
 * template\---which describes how the record appears in memory\---and again
 * as an external template\---which describes how the record appears in the
 * IPFIX message.
 *
 * Templates use internal reference counting, so they may be added to multiple
 * sessions, or to the same session using multiple template IDs or multiple
 * domains, or as both an internal and an external template on the same
 * session.
 *
 * Once the templates have been added to the session, use
 * fbSessionExportTemplates() to add the templates to the buffer and then
 * set the internal and external template IDs with fBufSetInternalTemplate()
 * and fBufSetExportTemplate().  You can then use fBufAppend() to write
 * records into IPFIX Messages and Messages to the output stream.
 *
 * If using Spread, call fBufSetSpreadExportGroup() to set the groups to
 * export to on the buffer before calling fBufAppend().
 *
 * By default, fBufAppend() will emit an IPFIX Message to the output stream
 * when the end of the message buffer is reached on write. The
 * fBufSetAutomaticMode() call can be used to modify this behavior, causing
 * fBufAppend() to return FB_ERROR_EOM when at end of message. Use this if
 * your application requires manual control of message export. In this case,
 * fBufEmit() will emit a Message to the output stream.  If your exporter was
 * created via fbExporterAllocBuffer(), you may use fbExporterGetMsgLen() to
 * get the message length.
 *
 * If not in automatic mode and a session's templates do not fit into a single
 * message, use fbSessionExportTemplate() to export each template individually
 * instead of relying on fbSessionExportTemplates().
 *
 * Manual control of message export is incompatible with template and
 * information element metadata (fbSessionSetMetadataExportTemplates() and
 * fbSessionSetMetadataExportElements()).  There are several functions that
 * may cause the metadata options records to be exported, and the session must
 * be free to create a new record set or template set as needed.
 *
 *
 * @page read IPFIX File Collectors
 *
 * How-To Read IPFIX Files
 *
 * Using fixbuf to read from IPFIX Files as a Collecting Process is very much
 * like the @ref export "Export case".
 * Create an fbInfoModel_t using fbInfoModelAlloc()
 * and any additional, vendor-specific information elements using
 * fbInfoModelAddElement(), fbInfoModelAddElementArray(),
 * fbInfoModelReadXMLFile(), or fbInfoModelReadXMLData().  Next create
 * an fbSession_t using fbSessionAlloc() and add internal templates via
 * fbSessionAddTemplate(). External templates do not need to be added
 * for collection, as they will be loaded from templates in the file.
 *
 * Then create an fbCollector_t to encapsulate the file, using the
 * fbCollectorAllocFP() or fbCollectorAllocFile() calls.
 *
 * With an fbSession_t and an fbCollector_t available, create a buffer for
 * writing via fBufAllocForCollection(). Set the internal template
 * ID with fBufSetInternalTemplate(), and use
 * fBufNext() to read records from IPFIX Messages and Messages from the
 * input stream.
 *
 * By default, fBufNext() will consume an IPFIX Message from the input stream
 * when the end of the message buffer is reached on read. The
 * fBufSetAutomaticMode() call can be used to modify this behavior,
 * causing fBufNext() to return FB_ERROR_EOM when at end of message. Use
 * this if your application requires manual control of message collection.
 * In this case, fBufNextMessage() will consume a Message from the input
 * stream.
 *
 * @page collect Network Collectors
 *
 * How-To Listen Over the Network Using TCP (Recommended)
 *
 * An additional type, @ref fbListener_t, is used to build Collecting Processes
 * to listen for connections from IPFIX Exporting Processes via the network.
 * To use a listener, first create an fbInfoModel_t using fbInfoModelAlloc()
 * and any additional, vendor-specific information elements using
 * fbInfoModelAddElement(), fbInfoModelAddElementArray(),
 * fbInfoModelReadXMLFile(), or fbInfoModelReadXMLData().  Next create
 * an fbSession_t using fbSessionAlloc() and add internal templates via
 * fbSessionAddTemplate(). Instead of
 * maintaining state for a particular Transport Session, this fbSession_t
 * instance will be used as a template for each Transport Session created
 * by the listener.
 *
 * Then create an fbListener_t to encapsulate a passive socket on the network
 * to wait for connections from Exporting Processes using the
 * fbListenerAlloc() call.
 *
 * To wait for a connection from an Exporting Process, call fbListenerWait(),
 * which handles the cloning of the fbSession_t, the creation of the
 * fbCollector_t, and the creation of the buffer for reading from that
 * collector, and returns the newly created fBuf_t instance.
 *
 * A listener binds to each address returned by getaddrinfo().  Once a
 * packet has been received, the collector will only read packets on the
 * address it received the first packet UNLESS fbListenerWait() is called
 * again.  If the application is expecting multiple connections or IPFIX
 * records from multiple IPFIX (UDP) exporters, then the application should
 * put the fBuf_t returned from fbListenerWait() into to manual mode by
 * calling fBufSetAutomaticMode() with FALSE as the second argument and
 * handle FB_ERROR_EOM errors
 * returned from fBufNext() by calling fbListenerWait() again.
 *
 * Each listener tracks every active collector/buffer (i.e., each active
 * Session) it created; the fbListenerWait() call will return an fBuf_t from
 * which another IPFIX Message may be read if no new connections are available.
 * The preferred parameter may be used to request an fBuf_t to try first, to
 * minimize switching among available Sessions. See the documentation for
 * fbListenerWait() for more details.
 *
 * If an application wants to wait for connections on multiple ports or
 * multiple transport protocols, the application can use fbListenerGroupWait()
 * to accept multiple connections.  The application should create separate
 * sessions and fbConnSpec_ts for each fbListener and call fbListenerAlloc()
 * to allocate each listener.  Create an fbListenerGroup_t by calling
 * fbListenerGroupAlloc() and add each listener to the group using
 * fbListenerGroupAddListener().  Instead of calling fbListenerWait(), use
 * the function fbListenerGroupWait() to listen on all addresses in the group.
 * fbListenerGroupWait() returns an fbListenerGroupResult_t which is a linked
 * list of results.  The fbListenerGroupResult_t contains a pointer to an
 * fBuf_t and the fbListener_t that created the fBuf_t as well as a pointer
 * to the next result, if available.  Use fbListenerFreeGroupResult() to free
 * the result when fBufNext() has been called on each fBuf_t.
 *
 * The application could also use fbListenerWaitNoCollectors() to handle only
 * the initial accepting of a connection (for TCP).  Once the application
 * returns to fbListenerWaitNoCollectors(), fixbuf will ignore that socket
 * descriptor for the length of the connection.
 *
 * Additionally, the application can use fbListenerOwnSocketCollectorTCP()
 * to provide its own socket for listening instead of libfixbuf creating
 * one for it.
 *
 * To reject incoming connections, the application should use the
 * @ref fbListenerAppInit_fn function callback.  This will be called right
 * after accept() is called (in the TCP case).  The application can veto the
 * connection by returning FALSE.  Once the connection is vetoed, fixbuf
 * will not listen on that socket descriptor.
 * If the appinit() function should reject a connection the application
 * should set the error code to FB_ERROR_NLREAD and the application should
 * ignore FB_ERROR_NLREAD error codes.  The appinit() function works slightly
 * different for UDP.  See the @ref udp "UDP instructions" for how to use
 * appinit() for collecting IPFIX over UDP.
 *
 * @page udp UDP Collectors
 *
 * How-To Collect IPFIX over UDP
 *
 * It is not recommended to use UDP for IPFIX transport, since
 * UDP is not a reliable transport protocol, and therefore cannot guarantee
 * the delivery of messages.  libfixbuf stores sequence numbers and reports
 * potential loss of messages.  Templates over UDP must be re-sent at regular
 * intervals.  Fixbuf does not automatically retransmit messages at regular
 * intervals, it is left to the application author to call
 * fbSessionExportTemplates().  In accordance with RFC 7011, the templates
 * should be resent at least three times in the Template refresh timeout
 * period.  Make sure the record size does not exceed the path MTU.
 * libfixbuf will return an error if the message exceeds the path MTU.
 *
 * A UDP collector session is associated with a unique IP, observation domain
 * pair.  UDP sessions timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity.  When a session
 * times out, all templates and state are discarded, this includes any related
 * NetFlow v9 templates and/or state.  libfixbuf will discard
 * any data records for which it does not contain a template for. Template IDs
 * are unique per UDP session (IP and Observation Domain.) Once
 * templates are refreshed, old templates may not be used or referenced by
 * the collecting session.  A UDP collector manages multiple sessions on
 * one collector and fBuf.  If the application is using the @ref
 * fbListenerAppInit_fn and @ref fbListenerAppFree_fn functions to maintain
 * context per session, it is
 * necessary to call fbCollectorGetContext() after each call to fBufNext() to
 * receive the correct context pointer (as opposed to calling it after
 * fbListenerWait() returns in the TCP case).  If the application needs to
 * manage context PER SESSION, the application must turn on multi-session mode
 * w/ fbCollectorSetUDPMultiSession() (this allows for backwards compatibility
 * with old applications.)  Previously, the appinit() function was called
 * only from fbListenerAlloc() for UDP connections, which did not allow the
 * application the peer information.  The appinit() function is now called
 * during fbListenerAlloc() (with a NULL peer address) and also when
 * a new UDP connection is made to the collector, giving the application
 * veto power over session creation.  If the application does not call
 * fbCollectorSetUDPMultiSession(), the application will not receive the
 * callback to it's appinit() function, which only allows the application
 * to set one context pointer on all sessions.  Likewise, appfree() is only
 * called once, when the collector is freed, if not in multi-session mode.
 * If the application is in multi-session mode, appfree() will be called
 * once for each session when the collector is freed AND anytime a session
 * is timed out.
 *
 * Note: If the appinit() function returns FALSE, libfixbuf will reject any
 * subsequent messages from the peer address, observation domain until the
 * timeout period has expired.  If the appinit() function should reject a
 * "connection" the application should set the error code to FB_ERROR_NLREAD
 * and return FALSE. Example usage:
 * \code{.c}
 *     g_set_error(error, FB_ERROR_DOMAIN, FB_ERROR_NLREAD, "some msg");
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * To only accept IPFIX from one host without using the appinit() and
 * appfree() functions, it is encouraged to
 * use fbCollectorSetAcceptOnly().  UDP messages received from other hosts
 * will return FB_ERROR_NLREAD.  The application should ignore errors with
 * this error code by clearing the error and calling fBufNext().

 * @page v9  NetFlow v9 Collectors
 *
 * How-To Use libfixbuf as a NetFlow v9 Collector
 *
 * libfixbuf can be used as a [NetFlow v9][] collector and convert NetFlow to
 * IPFIX.  Follow the @ref udp "steps above" to create an fbListener.
 * After creating
 * the listener, retrieve the collector by calling fbListenerGetCollector()
 * before calling fbCollectorSetNetflowV9Translator().  Fixbuf can decode all
 * NetFlow v9 information elements up to 346.  Since fixbuf removes the
 * SysUpTime from the NetFlow v9 Header, when fixbuf encounters elements 21
 * and 22 (which rely on the SysUpTime to determine flow start and end times)
 * it will add IPFIX Element 160 (systemInitTimeMilliseconds) to the template
 * and corresponding flow record. systemInitTimeMilliseconds is the Packet
 * Export Time (found in the NetFlow v9 Header) converted to milliseconds
 * minus the SysUpTime. Also, for arbitrary Cisco Elements (ID > 346), fixbuf
 * will convert the element ID to 9999 in order to decode the element properly.
 * The exceptions are elements 33002 (NF_F_FW_EXT_EVENT) and 40005
 * (NF_F_FW_EVENT) which are often exported from Cisco's ASA device. These
 * elements will be converted to their corresponding element id's in
 * libfixbuf's default Information Model, 9997 and 9998 respectively.
 * Similarly, the Cisco ASA will also export elements 40001, 40002, 40003,
 * and 40004.  These elements are substituted with the IPFIX elements 225, 226,
 * 227, and 228 respectively.
 *
 * libfixbuf will also convert NetFlow v9 Options Templates and Options Records
 * to IPFIX.  Due to the differences between IPFIX and NetFlow v9 Options
 * Templates the NetFlow v9 Scope Field Type is dropped and replaced with the
 * Information Element ID 263, messageScope.  The Scope Field Length will
 * be carried over to the IPFIX Options Template, and the messageScope will
 * have the length specified by Scope Field Length.  This holds true for all
 * Scope Elements defined in the NetFlow v9 Options Template.  In order to
 * retrieve the value for the Scope Field Type, the IPFIX internal template
 * should use the messageScope Information Element and use the length
 * override (the default length for messageScope is 1).
 *
 * libfixbuf differentiates NetFlow v9 streams by IP and observation domain.
 * If no activity is seen from a NetFlow v9 exporter within 30 minutes, the
 * session and all the templates associated with it will be freed. It is best
 * to set the template timeout period on the device to under 30 minutes.
 *
 * fbCollectorGetNetflowMissed() can be used to retrieve the number of
 * potential missed export packets.  This is not the number of FLOW records
 * that the collector has missed.  NetFlow v9 increases sequence numbers
 * by the number of export packets it has sent, NOT the number of flow
 * records.  An export packet may not contain any flow records.  Fixbuf
 * tries to account for any reboot of the device and not count large
 * sequence number discrepancies in it's missed count.
 *
 * To disable NetFlow v9 log messages such as sequence number mismatch
 * messages, option template removal messages, and record count discrepancy
 * messages, run `make clean`, `CFLAGS="-DFB_SUPPRESS_LOGS=1" make -e`,
 * `make install` when installing libfixbuf.

 * @page sflow sFlow Collectors
 *
 * How-To Use libfixbuf to Collect sFlow v5
 *
 * libfixbuf can be used to collect sFlow and convert sFlow to
 * IPFIX.  Follow the @ref udp "steps above" to create an fbListener.
 * After creating
 * the listener, retrieve the collector by calling fbListenerGetCollector()
 * before calling fbCollectorSetSFlowTranslator().  Essentially, the libfixbuf
 * translator is an IPFIX mediator which converts sFlow to IPFIX.  sFlow v5 is
 * a fixed format protocol.  The same steps are used to retrieve flow records
 * from the buffer, call fBufNext().  The internal template should contain
 * some subset of the fields listed below.  sFlow Data Records will have a
 * template ID of 0xEEEE and the Options Records will have a template ID of
 * 0xEEEF.
 *
 * Fixbuf first reads the sFlow header to ensure the buffer contains
 * sFlow v5.  Fixbuf currently only has support for sFlow v5.  The
 * sFlow header only contains the time since the device last rebooted
 * (but not the time of reboot) and this time will be reported in the
 * systemInitTimeMilliseconds field. Fixbuf records the time that the
 * sFlow message was received in the collectionTimeMilliseconds field.
 * Once the first message has been received, the translator will
 * create an external buffer and export the fixed templates to the
 * fixbuf session.  Note: the first sFlow message that fixbuf receives
 * will not be processed - this is used to setup the translation
 * process.  The translator will keep track of sequence numbers per
 * peer (IP)/observation domain (agent ID) by default.  There are
 * multiple sequence numbers in sFlow.  Each sFlow message has a
 * sequence number and each sample has a sequence number.  The sFlow
 * message sequence number is used to determine if sFlow messages have
 * been dropped.  Fixbuf will report if either sequence number is out
 * of sequence and emit a warning. The warning is just for
 * notification, libfixbuf will process all well-formed samples that
 * it receives.
 *
 * libfixbuf will process Flow Samples (1), Extended Flow Samples (3), Counter
 * Samples (2), and Extended Counter Samples (4).  Any other format will
 * return an FB_ERROR_SFLOW.  Applications should ignore (and potentially log)
 * FB_ERROR_SFLOW errors.  FB_ERROR_SFLOW errors are not fatal.
 * With an sFlow sample, fixbuf can handle the following formats:
 *
 * - Raw Packet Data, enterprise = 0, format = 1
 * - Ethernet Frame Data, enterprise = 0, format = 2
 * - IPv4 Data, enterprise = 0, format = 3
 * - IPv6 Data, enterprise = 0, format = 4

 * @page spread Spread Collectors
 *
 * How-To Use the Spread Protocol
 *
 * The instructions for using [Spread][] in libfixbuf are similar to the
 * setup for reading from IPFIX files.  As described above in the @ref export
 * "Exporters"
 * section, the first step is to create an fbInfoModel_t and fbSession_t.
 * Next, create the internal template(s) and add it to the fbSession_t.
 * Define an @ref fbSpreadParams_t and set the session, groups to subscribe to,
 * and Spread Daemon name.  Example usage:
 *     \code{.c}
 *       fbSpreadParams_t spread;
 *       char *groups[25];
 *       groups[0] = strdup("group1");
 *       groups[1] = '\0';
 *       spread.daemon = "daemon1"
 *       spread.groups = groups;
 *       spread.session = session;
 *       collector = fbCollectorAllocSpread(0, &spread, &err);
 *     \endcode
 *
 * Then create an fbCollector_t to connect and listen to the Spread Daemon
 * using fbCollectorAllocSpread().
 *
 * With an fbSession_t and fbCollector_t available, create a buffer for
 * writing via fBufAllocForCollection().  Set the internal template ID with
 * fBufSetInternalTemplate(), and use fBufNext() to read records from IPFIX
 * Messages published to the group your collector is subscribing to.
 *
 * To view all the Spread Groups that were sent the incoming record, call
 * fbCollectorGetSpreadReturnGroups() on the collector.

 *
 * @page noconnect Connection-less Collector
 *
 * How-To Use libfixbuf with a Data Buffer
 *
 * To use fixbuf independent of the transport mode, the application must
 * create an fbInfoModel_t using fbInfoModelAlloc()
 * and any additional, vendor-specific information elements using
 * fbInfoModelAddElement(), fbInfoModelAddElementArray(),
 * fbInfoModelReadXMLFile(), or fbInfoModelReadXMLData().  Next create
 * an fbSession_t using fbSessionAlloc() and add internal templates via
 * fbSessionAddTemplate().
 * The application will handle all connections and reading and simply
 * pass fixbuf
 * the buffer to be decoded.  The buffer must contain valid IPFIX and should
 * begin with the standard IPFIX header.  Ideally, the application should
 * provide the necessary templates before any data records to ensure that
 * the application can decode all of the data records.
 *
 * The application should NOT create an fbCollector.  To create the fBuf,
 * use fBufAllocForCollection() and set the second parameter to NULL.
 * The application then has everything needed to start reading from the IPFIX
 * source.  Ideally, the application will read the first 4 bytes of the message
 * first to determine the length of the next IPFIX message.  The first 2 bytes
 * are the IPFIX version (0x000A) and the third and fourth bytes are the length
 * of the following IPFIX message (including the IPFIX message header). The
 * application should then continue reading the length of the IPFIX message
 * into an allocated buffer.  The buffer should then be set on the fBuf by
 * calling fBufSetBuffer(). The application will continue to call fBufNext()
 * to receive the data records until fBufNext() returns FALSE with error
 * code FB_ERROR_BUFSZ.  However, if the fBuf is in manual mode
 * (see fBufSetAutomaticMode()) AND the application was reading the
 * message length, fixbuf will first return an FB_ERROR_EOM which will
 * signal to the application to perform another read (if the application
 * ignores FB_ERROR_EOM errors and calls fBufNext(), fBufNext() will then
 * return FB_ERROR_BUFSZ). This error notifies the application that there is
 * not enough data in the buffer to read a full IPFIX message.  If the
 * application only read the size of the IPFIX message, the entire buffer
 * should have been read.  However, if the application was reading more than
 * the IPFIX message length, additional data may remain in the buffer that
 * belongs to the next IPFIX message.  To determine how much data was left
 * in the buffer unread, fBufRemaining() will return the length
 * of the buffer that was not processed.  That remaining data should be copied
 * to the beginning of the buffer and the remaining IPFIX message data should
 * be read.  After each read, the application needs to call fBufSetBuffer().
 * Note that fBufSetBuffer() sets the collector and exporter on the fBuf to
 * NULL.  The application should clear the FB_ERROR_BUFSZ and/or FB_ERROR_EOM
 * error when they occur using g_clear_error().
 *
 * fixbuf may return the following error codes if it encounters one
 * of the below issues.  The application should determine the error and
 * respond appropriately.
 *
 *  - FB_ERROR_IPFIX
 *     - If the first 2 bytes != 0x000A
 *     - If the length in the header < 16
 *  - FB_ERROR_EOM
 *     - If the application read only the message length and the application
 *       called fBufSetAutomaticMode(fbuf, FALSE) (the fBuf is in manual mode).
 *       This means the remaining buffer length == 0 and the application
 *       should clear the error and perform another read
 *  - FB_ERROR_BUFSZ
 *     - If the header message length > the given buffer length
 *     - if the given buffer == NULL
 *     - If the given buffer length < 16
 *     - If buffer length == 0
 *
 *
 * Example usage:
 * \code{.c}
 *    FILE *fp;
 *    uint8_t buf[65535];
 *    ...
 *    while (fread(buf, 1, 4, fp) == 4) {
 *       len = ntohs(*((uint16_t *)(buf+2)));
 *       rc = fread(buf+4, 1, len-4, fp);
 *       if (rc > 0) {
 *           fBufSetBuffer(fbuf, buf, rc+4);
 *       } else if (feof(fp))
 *       ....
 *       for (;;) {
 *           ret = fBufNext(fbuf, (uint8_t *)rec, &len, &err);
 *           if (FALSE == ret) {
 *              if (g_error_matches(err, FB_ERROR_DOMAIN, FB_ERROR_BUFSZ)){

 * @page lists Lists in IPFIX
 *
 * How-To Handle BasicLists, SubTemplateLists, & SubTemplateMultiLists
 *
 * @section general General Information
 *
 * Background on the list types is in "Export of Structured Data in IPFIX"
 * ([RFC 6313][]).  Each of the list structures uses a nested list of data.
 * The basic list nests a single information element, while the others use a
 * nested template.  The template used for nesting is part of the listed
 * templates sent to the collector when the connection is made, or when the
 * data transfer begins.  There is no way to mark a template from this list as
 * one that will be nested, or one that will be used as the highest level
 * template.  Each of the templates in the list are treated as equals.
 *
 * [RFC 6313]:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6313
 *
 * The collector does not learn which template or information element is nested
 * until the data arrives.  This requires flexibility in the collectors to
 * handle each of the possible results.
 *
 * @subsection internalTemplates Internal Templates for Sub Templates
 * The setting of the internal template has not changed with the addition of
 * the list structures.  The internal template is still used to perform the
 * initial decoding of the data that arrives at the collector.
 *
 * Basic lists are not transcoded in the same way as templates because they
 * contain just one information element, thus having no order, so the data can
 * just be parsed and copied to a buffer.
 *
 * The question with decoding sub templates becomes, what do we use as an
 * internal template for any sub templates that arrive?  The answer is a new
 * structure in fixbuf that pairs external and internal template IDs for use
 * in decoding sub templates.  The pairs are added to the session that is used
 * for the connection, using fbSessionAddTemplatePair().
 *
 * Because the external template IDs are only unique for that session, the
 * collector must know the IDs of the templates that are collected in order to
 * pair an internal template with the external template.  As a result, callback
 * functionality may be enabled (via  fbSessionAddNewTemplateCallback())
 * to alert the user when a new external
 * template has arrived.  The callback functions are stored in the session
 * structure, which manages the templates.  The callback function,
 * @ref fbNewTemplateCallback_fn, receives the session
 * pointer, the template, the template ID, a context pointer for the
 * application to use, and the location in which to store the template's
 * context variable.  The
 * callback also gives the user another callback that can be used to free the
 * context variable upon template deletion.  This information is sufficient for
 * the application to successfully add template pairs to the session for sub
 * template decoding.
 *
 * If the application does not use the callback or does not add any template
 * pairs to the session, then fixbuf will transcode each of the sub templates
 * as if the external and internal template were same.  This causes all of the
 * fields sent over the wire to be transcoded into the data buffer on the
 * collecting side.  The details of that template are passed up to the
 * collector upon receipt of data so it knows how the data is structured in
 * the buffer.
 *
 * If the application adds any template pair to the list, then the list will be
 * referenced for each transcode.  Any external template the application
 * wishes to process MUST have an entry in the list.
 * There are 3 cases for entries in the list:
 *   -# There is no entry for the given external template ID, so the entire
 *      sub template is ignored by the transcoder.
 *      The collector will be given a sub template list (or multi list entry)
 *      struct with the number of elements in the list set to 0, and the data
 *      pointer set to NULL.
 *   -# The listing exists, and the external and internal template IDs are set
 *      to the same value.  When decoding, the list of internal templates is
 *      queried to see if a template exists with the same ID as the external
 *      template. If not, the transcoder decodes each of the
 *      information elements, in the same order, into the buffer. This is a
 *      change as setting them equal to each other used to force a full decode.
 *      This change highlights the need for careful template ID management.
 *   -# The listing exists, and the external and internal template IDs are
 *      different.  This will transcode in the standard way external templates
 *      have been transcoded into internal templates, selecting the desired
 *      elements (listed in the internal template) from the data that arrived
 *      in the external template.
 *
 *
 *
 * @subsection iterating Iterating Over the Lists
 * There are four scenarios in which the user needs to iterate through the
 * elements in a list, whether to fill in, or process the data:
 *  -#  Iterating over the repeated information element data in a basic list
 *  -#  Iterating over the decoded data elements in a sub template list
 *  -#  Iterating over the entries that make up a sub template multi list
 *  -#  Iterating over the decoded data elements in an entry of a sub template
 *      multi list
 * The two iterating mechanisms are the same in each case:
 * Each of the function names start with the structure being iterated over,
 * e.g., fbBasicList, or fbSubTemplateMultiListEntry
 *  -# Indexing
 *     The function used here is (structName)GetIndexed(dataPtr or entry)()
 *     It takes a pointer to the struct, and the index to be retrieved.
 *     Example usage:
 *     \code{.c}
 *          for(i = 0; myStructPtr = ...GetIndexedDataPtr(listPtr, i); i++) {
 *              process the data that myStructPtr points to.
 *          }
 *      \endcode
 *     The loop will end when the function returns NULL because
 *     i is beyond the end of the list.
 *
 *  -# Incrementing
 *     The function used here is (structName)GetNext(dataPtr or entry)()
 *     It takes a pointer to the struct, and a pointer to an element in the
 *     list.  Pass in NULL at the beginning to get the first element back.
 *     Example usage:
 *     \code{.c}
 *          myStructPtr = NULL;
 *          while(myStructPtr = ...GetNextPtr(listPtr, myStructPtr)) {
 *              process the data that myStructPtr points to.
 *          }
 *      \endcode
 *     The loop will end when the function returns NULL because
 *     it gets passed the end of the list.  A key part here is
 *     initializing myStructPtr to NULL at the beginning.

 *
 * How-To Export and Read Enterprise Element Definitions
 *
 * @section what_5610 What is RFC 5610?
 *
 * [RFC 5610][] provides a mechanism to export full type information for
 * Information Elements from the IPFIX Information Model.  Libfixbuf
 * version 1.4 and later provides API functions to create IPFIX
 * Option Template/Records that can encode the full set of properties
 * for the definition of an Information Element in order for a
 * Collecting Process to be able to know how to decode data that
 * contains enterprise-specific Information Elements.
 *
 * [RFC 5610]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5610
 *
 * @section exp RFC 5610 Exporters
 *
 * To create a new enterprise-specific Information Element, the
 * Exporting Process should define a new information element using the
 * FB_IE_INIT_FULL() macro to provide the name, private enterprise
 * number, id, length, description, data type, and units of the
 * information element.  The Information Elements should then be added
 * to the Information Model using fbInfoModelAddElement() or
 * fbInfoModelAddElementArray().  Alternatively, a file or a string
 * containing an XML registry that describes Information Elements may
 * be parsed and loaded into the Information Model using
 * fbInfoModelReadXMLFile() or fbInfoModelReadXMLData().
 *
 * Once an enterprise-specific information element exists, there are
 * two ways to export that information.  The simplest way is to
 * configure automated enterprise-specific information element
 * information export.  This is done by calling
 * fbSessionSetMetadataExportElements() with the `enabled` parameter set to
 * `TRUE`.  Once this has been set, the full set of information
 * elements in the information model that have a non-zero Private
 * Enterprise Number will be exported every time template records are
 * exported (fbSessionExportTemplates()).
 *
 * The other option is to export the information element options
 * records manually. An information element options template can then
 * be created using fbInfoElementAllocTypeTemplate().  This creates an
 * option template that contains all of the necessary properties to
 * define an Information Element:
 *
 * - privateEnterpriseNumber
 * - informationElementId
 * - informationElementDataType
 * - informationElementSemantics
 * - informationElementUnits
 * - informationElementRangeBegin
 * - informationElementRangeEnd
 * - informationElementName
 * - informationElementDescription
 *
 * Then the template can be added to the session using
 * fbSessionAddTemplate().  You will need to add it twice, once as an
 * internal template, and once as an external template.  Create the
 * exporter and fbuf as described above for the necessary mode of
 * transport.  Then, to write out an information element options
 * record, use fbInfoElementWriteOptionsRecord(), using the template
 * IDs returned by the fbSessionAddTemplate() calls as the internal
 * and export template IDs, passing it a pointer to the information
 * element you want to export.  For example:
 *
 *  \code{.c} fbInfoElementWriteOptionsRecord(fbuf, fbInfoModelGetElementByName(infoModel, "myNewElement"), itid, etid, *err); \endcode
 *
 * The Options Record will automatically be appended to the fbuf
 * and will be sent upon calling fBufEmit().
 *
 * @section col RFC 5610 - Collector Usage
 *
 * In order to collect the above Options records, the collecting

 *
 * To see a complete program that uses the fixbuf library, look at the
 * ipfix2json and ipfixDump programs in the [fixbuf-tools][] package.  In
 * addition, two sample programs are available as separate bundles.  These are
 * designed to read IPFIX data that matches the templates used by YAF:
 *
 * - [yaf_file_mediator][] Reads IPFIX records from a file and writes the records as text.
 * - [yaf_silk_mysql_mediator][] Reads IPFIX records from a file or a TCP socket and stores the records in a MySQL database and/or forwards the records to SiLK.
 *
 * For larger programs, see the applications on the
 * https://tools.netsa.cert.org/ web site:
