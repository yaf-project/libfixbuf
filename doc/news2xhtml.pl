#
# Each entry is a pair (an array) containing a regex and a string.
# The regex is compared to the version in the NEWS file (the text
# after "Version " and before the date), and if it matches, the string
# is checked.  If the string has the value $no_print, the entry is not
# printed; if the string is empty or undef, the entry is printed
# without a download link; otherwise the string names the license to
# use for the download link.  If the regex does not match, the next
# entry in the array is tried.  If no match for the version is found
# in the table, the entry is printed but no download link is added for
# that release.
